    <h1 style="color: white; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Hey you! You're finally awake!</h1>
    <p style="font: bolder; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: white; font-size: 20px;">this website is hosted, well by me, Ewout! <br>
    Made possible by multiple people, this effort was not only done by myself but also some others, <br>
    I'd like to thank <strong style="color: tomato;">6ICT</strong> for kick-starting this project. Even though, they didn't have anything to do with it, <br>
    while I was bored in class, I thought of this and got support for it all ways! <br><br>
    
    Some other people I'd like to thank first and foremost as friends or classmates and giving me even a tiny helping hand would be, <br>
    <strong style="color: rgb(174, 126, 219); font-size: 30px;">Xander</strong> for criticizing the page when I first showed it to him. Well his attitude wasn't the greatest but friends am I right! <br>
    yeah and thats it for now, enjoy the webpage, you can scroll through or drag the projects list above to change projects. You can also have a look at the one and only or look at my education. <br><br>

    <strong style="color: sandybrown;">Have Fun!</strong></p>
