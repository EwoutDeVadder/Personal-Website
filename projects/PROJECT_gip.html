    <h1>School End Project</h1>
    <p>As my final year's project I need to make a system which is able to, at a basic level, forecast dynamic energy prices (DEP) and adapt to them. <br>
    This sounds simple enough but it actually requires a couple of steps, first and foremost I need to get the DEPs from somewhere. Currently I am getting the data from a website which is done using a website scraper.
    I am using <strong style="color: #b95573;">Beautifulsoup 3</strong> but any other scraper can be used to aquire the HTML page automatically.<br><br>
    
    The other is the weather, I have to make sure to also predict according to the weather forecast aswell, luckily for me I am using Home Assistant as a base to build my project on. Home Assistant has a built in feature for this. <br>
    I haven't yet added weather forecast into the calculations so this is still in the work but shouldn't be too hard to add. <br> <br>

    This project it a little bit (very much) outdated and not updated. I will put some effort later on, keep hanging thight!
