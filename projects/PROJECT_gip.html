    <h1>School End Project</h1>
    <p>Currently I'm in my last year of middleschool and slowly becoming of age
        to drive (I'm really looking forward to it..).
    </p>
    <p>Thing is though, my driving exam isn't the only thing in the future, so is my
        end project for this school year. I couldn't choose a project myself but that
        doesn't really matter because the project the school gave me is pretty chill
        aswell.
    </p>
    <p>They said I'd make a program which says if it's a good time to use electricity
        in function of the dynamical prices. It seems simple enough in words but I don't
        know what obstacles I'm going to come across when coding it.
    </p>
    <p>Thats not the only thing! THERE'S MORE!! It's not really a bad thing though,
        It looks pretty easy aswell, I just need to also upload the data I gather
        to a database which a fellow classmate is supposed to make.
    </p>
    <p>This all sounds simple enough and to be honest I think it's not going to be
        so hard but it can always be expanded. 
    </p>
