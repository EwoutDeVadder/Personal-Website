    <h1>A personal Website</h1>
    <p>I am currently working on a personal webiste which I can use to make myself known. <br><br>
    It's a project fully driven off of inspiration and or motivation, sometimes I work on it for 
    days or weeks. And sometimes it's sitting in my background collecting dust. <br><br>
    I am trying to make everything cool, nice and clean. Also I try to make everything a bit different, <br>
    on this page you can see that you can move the projects indefinetely. I coded all of it myself. I am really proud
    of it even if it's not that big of a feat. <br><br>
    On the next page you may find pictures of me moving from left to right. This is a completely different script and
    coded in a completely different way. <br><br>I tried to copy it from a youtube video but this never worked. So I wrote
    my version of it. I need to admit, the code is not clean, and I am not that proud of the way it looks back-end, but I am proud
    of the way it looks front-end.</p>
