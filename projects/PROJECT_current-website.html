    <h1>This Website</h1>
    <p>At the time of writing this, the website is not yet complete.
    </p>
    <p>I originally though of making one as a method to show small Projects
        I make along the years. Maybe I could even give some updates on what I'm doing
        and all.
    </p>
    <p>Its all still a work in progress but I setup a convenient github page for all the
        code. This is one, so I can easely transfer files between computers using git.
        Second if anyone wants to optimise  the code or I let someone in on the project
        aswell they can immediatly hop in aswell without a fuss. </p>
    <p>As for planning when I'm going to buy a domain and such, at the time of writing
        I got no idea to be completely frank. Probably when the site is in a usable
        state. 
    </p>
    <p>This implies that I need to finish, the About me page aswell as the Resources page.
        Also the footer is not yet done or rather, I haven't begun making it so that's that
        aswell.
