        My first project or rather my first documented one. <br>
        Back in my fifth year in middleschool, while I was bored in class, I decided that I wanted to make a website for myself. From that point, everytime I found
        time in class, i'd work on this project. Tried my best to document the process on Github, first it went rocky and the git commits were difficult to manage, 
        but as time went on, I started getting used to it until my Integrated Test took over my life in my final year in middleschool. <br><br>

        I never forgot this project, I did do many revisions, when going over the color palettes in a bit, you'll see I changed my mind a LOT about the general theme.
        Something that fit with me would be best, I didn't really know at the time which colors fit together and which didn't. In my first year of University though,
        I had a theme I was going for for myself, and along came the palette for the website. At the time of writing this, the colors are really barebones and I am not
        sure if I will stick with it, but it does have a certain charm. <br> <br>
