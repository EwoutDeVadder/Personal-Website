                            <p>At this point I didn't yet know what my passion would become, I was still young. 
                            Throughout the year I got in touch with electronics, like programming a robot or programming 
                            a minor game in scratch. This really peaked my interests and I decided I wanted to continue doing that.</p>

                            <h3>Electro-mechanica</h3>
                            <p>This was kind of a warm-up for ICT which I would be following in the next grade. A school I looked at 
                            decided this was the bes course of action and to learn Elecricity and Mechanics at an early phase.</p>

                            <h3>Information and Communication Technologies / ICT</h3>
                            <p>This was my favourite time in middleschool I ever had. I got a really nice class which I've really 
                            appreciated and I've had really good teachers there, willing to help, see you succeed. At the end Elecro- 
                            mechanica didn't save the day. We didn't see any Mechanics. Electricity was a major subject though. 
                            I am really lucky I did Electro-mechanica before ICT because I noticed some people dropping out after 
                            the first year because it was too difficult, or not their taste.</p>
                            <p style="position: absolute; left: 700px; margin-top: -165px; width: 800px;">
                            This was also the first year I got an integrated project. It was fun, not really the thing I would personally do 
                            but I liked working on it. At this point though, my vision of the future became vague a few times. First I wanted 
                            to continue in Software and become a gamedeveloper, but I've kind of out-grown that by the time I started third grade. 
                            So then I thought about AI, that's a really big interest of mine, thing is though, I couldn's see myself analyzing data 
                            days on end. So I opted out of that. Lastly Networking seemed like a nice thing to do. Installing servers, configuring 
                            switches, debugging a network, and those sort of things. I seem to be really interested in those kind of things and I 
                            scored good points on them. My teacher told me to become Industrial Engeneer and thats when I decided that I would do 
                            that in University.</p>
