# Project Description
I thought I'd be a good idea to make a website to get some more experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript and I hope
to put it on a NFC badge so I can easily refer to the website if someone wants to know a little more about me.
For now it's been a lot of fun and I've gone through a lot of different versions but this is the one I'm seeing
through till the end. (The other ones were left unfinished this is a bummer)
